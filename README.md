# DebateXML
DebateXML is an XML schema for the storage and analysis of data from parliamentary debating formats, designed to be very flexible and generalizable to various formats. DebateXML export is currently available in MIT-Tab (American Parliamentary), with patches available for Tabbie2 (British Parliamentary) and Tabbycat, including import.

The schema is available as the file `spec.xsd`. An enumeration of debating formats for reference when designing the format is also available.

A proposal for such a format was made by Philip Belesky and Chuan-Zheng Lee in 2015, and thereafter designed and implemented by Étienne Beaulé in 2019. This is the _Monash Debating Review_ article describing the motivation for this specification: [Philip Belesky and Chuan-Zheng Lee, "The Start of History", _Monash Debating Review_ vol. 13, 2015](https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/dta-spec/blob/master/The-Start-of-History.pdf)
